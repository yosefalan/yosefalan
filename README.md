### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer, musician, and dancer.

JavaScript is my native language, but I am conversational in Python. Able to navigate a full stack. Experienced with Node.js, Express.js, React, Redux, Flask, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, SQAlchemy. Also familiar with testing frameworks: Mocha, Cypress, and Pytest.

Able to quickly learn and apply new programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. I do some of my best work under pressure.

Ever the intrepid world traveler, I also dabble in non-programming languages: Spanish (fluent), Portuguese (conversational), Bahasa Indonesia (conversational), Tagalog (Basic), Thai (Basic).

I used to be a Salsa and Bachata dancer, but then I fell in love with Brazilian Zouk and never looked back. I train, teach, and social dance whenever I can. I also decided to use social distancing over the past couple years as an excuse to learn to sing and write songs. And already having a background in audio production, I am excited to explore the spaces where music production and technology meet.
