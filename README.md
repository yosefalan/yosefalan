### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer.

My journey in tech began when I was an audio production major in school. I worked closely with computer software and hardware in music and audio production,  I also took some web development courses and learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I would occasionally leverage those development skills as well as my self-taught graphic design skills to help people create websites or update content on their existing sites.

Working in hospitality when I was younger allowed me the freedom to pursue my passions: music, dance,  martial arts, and travel.  Eventually, through a combination of hard work, technical and business acumen, and strong interpersonal skills I was able to progress into leadership roles where I continued to advance my career into leadership positions. Both in the workplace and in my personal life, I have always been known as someone who could solve complex problems.  That has generally made me a go-to guy for helping with technical challenges ranging from configuring Pont of Sale systems, finding errors in financial reports, or creating sophisticated spreadsheets at work, to helping my relatives fix all their computer issues.  

When personal circumstances and a pandemic made it clear that it was time for a career change, I reflected on my strengths and remembered how passionate I was about using programmatic logic to solve problems as an operations manager.  So I  decided it was time to build a real foundation as a software engineer.   

I applied to App Academy, a challenging  Full Stack Web Development program with a 5% acceptance rate, and got in!  I was then able to fortify my frontend development skills and greatly expand my knowledge of JavaScript as well as adding new technologies to my repertoire such as React, Redux, and Node.js,  I also expanded my skills to include proficiency with backend technologies: Servers, APIs, and Databases using tools like Express, Python, Flask, and SQL,

Always hungry for growth and development, I am currently adding even more technologies to my skill set as I am learning Java, Spring, and Angular in the Fast Track Program with Cook Systems.
